Algorthim Notes: 

## Graph
- Prim’s Algorithm -> Minimum / Maximum Spanning Tree
- Kahn's Algorithm -> Topological sort
- Ford–Fulkerson's Algorithm -> for water/cars/internet/... from source to sink, running parallel + max flow 
- Dijkstra's algorithm -> shortest path between nodes 
- Lowest common ancestor -> dp log2n bitmask 


DAG -> direct graph, weigh, no cycle 

## Bit mask
(mask & (1 << j)): 

(k >> i) & 1 check if it is sum of pow of two examle 
k = 11 
i = 1 true
i = 2 true 
i = 8 true


## SQRT technique 
Idea: process small period + process big period in two different ways
